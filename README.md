# ruc-rap
Scripts used to analyze RUC-RAP model analyses GRIB/GRIB2 file types.

The sounding-analysis script generates a Skew-T Log-P plot with several convective parameters for a user-specified Lat/Lon point of interest.

The CM1-init-sounding script interpolates the vertical profile of a user-specified Lat/Lon point to a 10-meter vertical resolution and then generates a text file that contains the appropriate input-sounding data for use in CM1 and WRF idealized simulations.
